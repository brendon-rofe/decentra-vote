The DecentraVote system can be designed with a modular architecture, focusing on the backend components as the frontend is excluded. The architecture can be divided into the following components:

1.  Ethereum Blockchain (Smart Contract): The core of the DecentraVote system, a Solidity-based smart contract, will be responsible for managing elections, votes, and results on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures transparency, immutability, and security.
    
2.  Backend Server (Express.js): The backend server will act as an intermediary between the frontend (if implemented in the future) and the Ethereum blockchain. It will provide API endpoints for user authentication, election management, and vote submissions. The server will be built using Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.
    
3.  Database (MongoDB): MongoDB will be used for storing user accounts, election details, and other relevant off-chain information. This allows for efficient querying and storage of data that doesn't need to be stored on the blockchain.
    
4.  Blockchain Interface (Ethers.js): Ethers.js will be used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling the backend server to communicate with the smart contract, submit transactions, and read data from the blockchain.
    
5.  Authentication and Access Control: The system will include an authentication mechanism for users to securely access the platform and participate in elections. Role-based access control will be implemented to manage different user roles and permissions.
