The DecentraVote system will include the following functionality and features:

1.  User Registration and Authentication:
    
    -   Users can create accounts and securely authenticate to access the platform.
    -   Different user roles can be assigned, such as admin, organizer, or voter.
2.  Election Creation and Management:
    
    -   Admins or organizers can create new elections with customizable parameters, such as the election name, description, start and end dates, and the list of candidates.
    -   The system allows for managing ongoing and past elections, including updating election details, adding/removing candidates, and tracking the status of elections.
3.  Secure Voting Process:
    
    -   Registered voters can securely participate in elections within the specified time frame.
    -   Each voter is allowed to cast a single vote per election, and the system prevents double voting.
    -   The voting process ensures voter anonymity and maintains the confidentiality of individual votes.
4.  Election Results:
    
    -   Real-time election results are displayed as votes are cast, without waiting for the election to end.
    -   Once the election is over, the final results are available, including the number of votes per candidate and the overall turnout.
5.  Transparency and Immutability:
    
    -   The voting data, including the votes and election results, is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
    -   The smart contract guarantees that the voting process is tamper-proof and resistant to fraud.
6.  Role-Based Access Control:
    
    -   The system implements role-based access control to manage different user roles and permissions.
    -   This allows for fine-grained control over who can create and manage elections, participate in voting, and access election results.
7.  Scalability and Performance:
    
    -   The system is designed to handle a large number of elections and users without compromising performance or security.
    -   Off-chain storage (MongoDB) is used for efficient data management and to minimize the load on the Ethereum blockchain.
8.  API Endpoints:
    
    -   The backend server provides API endpoints for interacting with the system, allowing for easy integration with a frontend or other external applications.

By implementing these functionalities and features, DecentraVote will provide a secure, transparent, and user-friendly decentralized voting system that leverages blockchain technology and modern web development practices.
